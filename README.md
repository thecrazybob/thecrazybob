### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mohammed Sohail, a full stack web developer.
I thoughtfully design, expertly build and carefully maintain meaningful, results-driven websites and applications that are a pleasure to use. I mainly develop web applications in Laravel/PHP alongside Next.js, Livewire or Inertia.

I am currently pursuing my CS degree at Bilkent University, Ankara and I work as a freelance web developer.
